ABOUT THE DASHBOARD:  

This dashboard uses data from the Mapping Police Violence organization and displays cases of lethal police force in the United States over time and geography. Answering the question - how does lethal police force vary across the US? - this app uses an interactive map and data table, as well as race and age distribution charts. Furthermore, this dashboard is designed for community members and social justice advocates to use as a palatable format for distributing information about the use of lethal police force in the US. The datatable is designed to bring greater awareness for the vicitms of lethal police violence because they deserve to have their names known. This dashboard was motivated through the increased awareness and publicity of police brutality and aspires to assist advocacy groups and police departments to create the necessary changes to stop state-sanctioned violence. 

DATA SCIENCE CONCEPTS: 

This dashboard combines data visualization and data design concepts to generate an accessible and informative app. Data cleaning was also imperative for the deployment of this app because of the importance of clean and legible data for the accessiblity of the final dashboard. This project was built primarily through the use of dash and plotly which was used to build all of the interactivity and graphics. Additionally, knowledge of CSS and HTML were beneficial for creating a customizable design and layout with a custom color palette and specific element placement. Data design concepts were also beneficial for the layout process and building a dashboard that easily guides the user across the page and to the important elements. 

LEARNING EXPERIENCES: 

The process of building this dashboard encouraged critical thinking and problem solving skills to overcome obstacles. Furthermore, independent working and thinking was fostered and served to establish confidence in coding and problem solving. Additionally, this process relied heavily on the flexibility of design and feasibility of project components in order to create a cohesive and effective dashboard.
